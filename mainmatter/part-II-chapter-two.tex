Blood is a body fluid deliver. It's contains an transport many of the nutrients substances that the man and the other animals use to live. That we call blood is principally a fluid divided in two elements: blood cells and blood plasma. Normally an individual has around 5 Litre of blood. The plasma blood constitutes the 55\% of the total fluid. it is mostly water(92\% by volume) and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones and blood cells themselves.\cite{website:wiki} Mainly the cells are red blood cells and white blood cells(WBCs). In this dissertation we going to focus on WBC especially we will study the shape of these last.
White blood cells, also called leukocytes , are the cells with the task of controlling the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All leukocytes have a nuclei that distinguishes them by other blood cells, in particular red blood cells and platelets. The generic term leukocytes includes very different cells population: neutrophil, granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes. This set of three categories is defined as   polymorphonucleated granulocytes. The other set that includes monocytes and lymphocytes is defined agranulocytes mononuclear. In a nutshell leukocytes are dived in these two sets by the nuclei shape.\ref{fig:kindLeuko}

\section*{White blood cells segmentation}
Segment an image means divide an image in regions of interest. It's used to obtain a more compact image used to extract objects or to analyse an image. In this case the main feature is to find edges and white blood cells nuclei. At a first look seems a banal problem, because the we think that every single cell is strongly separated by the others, but obviously it is the best case that we can find. Commonly the microscope photos that we analyse contains noise and in particular the leukocytes overlaps both others leukocytes and red blood cells. For these reasons segment leukocytes is still an unresolved problem. As explain above there are 2 class of leukocytes that are dissimilar by the nuclei shape. this is an high problem because if the solution to find all the white blood cells was based on the search of circular shapes, it's trivial that it will be impossible to recognize a granulocytic from a monocyte.


There are a lot of heuristics and approaches that try to divide and classify white blood cells. This dissertation proposes a new approach of pure segmentation using the Vector Field Convolution, in particular tries to find a division between the overlaps between the cells. We choose this kind of field because the common practice to extract the features by the images utilizes thresholds, but what happens if the image has a low definition and all the cells are in overlap with their? Using that field to describe the image is possible to transcend by the shape of the features and focus themselves on the points that have a non-uniform virtual field. This technique then considers only the points that describe the edges of the white blood cells. After the image elaboration the result is an image that contains only leukocytes and when it is necessary dividing every kind of cells. With this result we can label every cell without human work.
