\chapter{The implementation}
For the implementation we followed the approach shows in the figure \ref{fig:diag}

\section{New kind of approach to segment leukocytes}
As we can see in literature, the main approach used to resolve the overlap problem is using the watershed transform. Here\ref{fig:overlap} there is an example of the watershed transform. Takes in input the image of the two overlapped circles, we calculate the distance transform, or in other words we calculate the Euclidean distance transform of the binary image BW. For each pixel in BW, the distance transform assigns a number that is the distance between that pixel and the nearest non-zero pixel of BW\ref{fig:overlaptransf}. Giving the distance transform result to the watershed algorithm we obtain a division between circles because the watershed transform finds "catchment basins" or "watershed ridge lines" in an image by treating it as a surface where light pixels represent high elevations and dark pixels represent low elevations \ref{fig:overlapwater}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{(a) Example of two circle in overlap, (b) Distance transform, (c) Watershed result}\label{fig:stepswater}
\end{figure}
This is an ideal case to analyse. But when we work with the overlapping between cells the result of the division by watershed transform is not optimal like the example \ref{fig:stepswater}. Probably the cause derived from the low definition of the figures and especially the shape of the cells. Here there is an example of what happened when we try to divide 3 cells in overlap \ref{fig:exOnImage7}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Im007_1_crop.png}
        \caption{ }

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{(a) Original leukocytes image, (b) Watershed transform applied to three cells in overlap}
	\label{fig:exOnImage7}
\end{figure}
As is possible to see, this method produce a no-realistic separation of the cells. For this reason we study a different method that in automatic way produce a realistic division of the cells. Starting from the resulting image after the application of the mean shift algorithm, we based our implementation using principally the output of the VFC field, the image relative to the External energy of the image to describe the edges, the median filter and the skeleton method.
\section{ALL-IDB blood cell dataset}
The images of the dataset have been captured with an optical laboratory microscope coupled with
a Canon PowerShot G5 camera. All images are in JPG format with 24-bit colour depth. The first 33
have $1712*1368$ resolution, the remaining have $2592*1944$ resolution. The images are taken with
different magnifications of the microscope ranging from 300 to 500 which brings the colour
differences that we managed grouping the images with same brightness characteristics together. The
ALL-IDB database has two distinct folders (ALL-IDB1 and ALL-IDB2).

\bigskip

The table \ref{tableidb} shows a little description about the images.
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline

\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\caption{Characteristics of the dataset. Images acquisition has been performed with a Canon PowerShot G5. Magnification of microscope goes from 300 to 500. The image format of the ALL- IDB1 folder images is JPG, ALL-IDB2 images have TIF format. The colour is 24 bit depth.}
\label{tableidb}
\end{table}
The IDB1 set can be used for testing segmentation capability of algorithms. This dataset is composed of 108 images collected during September, 2005. It contains about 39000 blood elements, where the lymphocytes has been labelled by expert oncologists.\cite{website:IDB}
The IDB2 set has been designed for testing the performances of classification systems. The ALL-IDB2 version 1.0 is a collection of cropped area of interest of normal and blast cells that belongs to the ALL-IDB1 dataset. ALL-IDB2 images have similar gray level properties to the images of the ALL-IDB1, except the image dimensions.\cite{website:IDB}
For our work we consider only normal type of leukocytes and we focused principally on the images where is present an overlap between the white blood cells.

\section{Mean shift application}
In order to resolve the illumination problems and to obtain a good visualization of the Wright-Giemsa stain cells we use the mean shift function. To obtain an acceptable result should be necessary do an image preprocessing, but using the bandwith parameters and the threshold parameter of the mean shift function we can obtain the same result. For our work we used $h_{s}$ (bandwith of the spatial kernel) = 4, $h_{r}$ (colour bandwith) = 4 and the threshold $th$ = 0.25. The result changing these parameters is not so significant in order to obtain a good final result, then is preferable use an image with a little bit definition but obtained in a very short time (2 seconds for cropped images and 40 seconds for the entire images). What that we have obtained very helpful to calculate the edge map that will give like attribute to the VFC function.

\section{The VFC result}
The VFC uses the two components of the external force ${u} _{vfc} ( x,y ) , {v} _{vfc} (x,y)$ to describe the field of the image and it's magnitude. Our purpose is find and image using these two components that describes all the leukocytes edges taking an accurate look on the edges in overlap. The first step then is extract the right component and the left component.
\begin{equation}
{u} _{vfc}=ExtF(x)/\sqrt{ExtF(x)^{2} + ExtF(y)^{2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{v} _{vfc}=ExtF(y)/\sqrt{ExtF(x)^{2} + ExtF(y)^{2}}
\end{equation}
where ExtF is the External force of the field. Now we have only an intensity image, but to understand how the field moves in the space we have to transform these two component $ u$ and $ v $ in grades. Do this step a mandatory because we want to understand the direction of every pixel in the figure especially the pixels that describe edges of cells. Is possible convert the two components in degrees using the $atan2d$ function \ref{fig:angle}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/angle.png}
		\caption{Degrees image}
		\label{fig:angle}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In order to delete all the uniform part of the figure and put in exalt the edges we use a mediand filter using the function $ordfilt2$ searching the 18th element of the $5 * 5$ mask \ref{fig:Pmedangle}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/PmedAngle.png}
		\caption{Median filter on degrees image}
		\label{fig:Pmedangle}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\section{External Energy}
As is possible to see in the result \ref{fig:angle}, there are a lot of points that are artefacts created by the field. For these reason we used the $bwdist$ function to assign a number that it is the distance between each pixel and the nearest no-zero pixel of the image. This trick is very useful because reduce the entropy of the image, focusing only on the shape of the leukocytes \ref{fig:bwdistangle}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/bwdistAngle.png}
		\caption{bwdist applied on degrees image}
		\label{fig:bwdistangle}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
But we have ever the same problem. in the image there are trace of the red blood cells, then we had to find a method to isolate only the leukocytes. We started using the external energy of the image. For an image $I(x,y)$ all the lines, edges and terminal points the general formulation of the Energy of the image is
\begin{equation}
 E_{image}=w_{line}E_{line} + w_{edge}E_{edge} + w_{term}E_{term}
\end{equation}
where $w_{line}, w_{edge}, w_{term}$ are weights of the features.

\subsection{Line functional}
The line functional or in other terms the intensity of the image is in a nutshell the attracted value of the dark lines to the light line. It's possible choose this attraction putting a positive or negative sign before the force that this attraction has to be.
\begin{equation}
	E_{{line}}=filter(I(x,y))
\end{equation}

\subsection{Edge functional}
The edge functional bases it's work on the image gradient.
\begin{equation}
E_{{edge}}=-\left|\nabla I(x,y)\right\vert ^{2}
\end{equation}
It's very useful because when we try to analyse the feature of the image, we work with maxims and minims. with this formula we can avoid the local minima that are not object of interest. The energy functional using scale space continuation is
\begin{equation}
E_{edge}=-\left|G_{\sigma }*\nabla ^{2}I\right\vert ^{2}
\end{equation}

where $ G_{\sigma } $ is a Gaussian with standard deviation $ \sigma $.

\subsection{Termination functional}
The curvature of the lines in a image is utilized to detect corners and terminations. Put 
\begin{equation}
C(x,y)=G_{{\sigma }}*I(x,y)
\end{equation}
with a gradient angle
\begin{equation}
\theta =\arctan {\Bigg (}{\frac  {C_{y}}{C_{x}}}{\Bigg )},
\end{equation}
unit vectors that move along the gradient direction 
\begin{equation}
{\mathbf  n}=(\cos \theta ,\sin \theta )
\end{equation}
and unit vectors perpendicular to the gradient direction
\begin{equation}
{\mathbf  n}_{{\perp }}=(-\sin \theta ,\cos \theta ).
\end{equation}
With these 4 equations we can describe the termination functional of energy as follow
\begin{equation}
E_{{term}}={\partial \theta  \over \partial n_{{\perp }}}={\partial ^{2}C/\partial ^{2}n_{{\perp }} \over \partial C/\partial n}={{C_{{yy}}C_{x}^{2}-2C_{{xy}}C_{x}C_{y}+C_{{xx}}C_{y}^{2}} \over (C_{x}^{2}+C_{y}^{2})^{{3/2}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{External energy result}
Now we have only to specify the value of each parameter explained above.
To obtain the desired outcome we did some empirical experiments, obtaining the best result with $ Wedge=8, Wline=-8 $ and $ Wterm=0$. this result \ref{fig:Eextforce} permit us to extract only the leukocytes part of the image using some analysis image exploit \ref{fig:onlyleu}.

		\caption{image of leukocytes without red blood cells}
		\label{fig:onlyleu}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In order to delete all the uniform part of the figure and put in exalt the edges we use a mediand filter using the function $ordfilt2$ searching the 18th element of the $5 * 5$ mask \ref{fig:Pmedonlyleu}.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\section{Combination of two results: the division method}
The two results that we obtained seems in no-correlation, but the skill of this segmentation lives in this passage. Using the overlay function we search all the points in overlay between the images \ref{fig:Pmedangle} and \ref{fig:Pmedonlyleu}, using the red color to isolate the leukocytes region \ref{fig:over}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/overlay.png}
		\caption{overlay of figures \ref{fig:Pmedangle} and \ref{fig:Pmedonlyleu}}
		\label{fig:over}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
We choose to use the red color, because if we isolating only the red component of the image we can obtain an image that contains only the leukocytes regions. The result of this task is visible in the image \ref{fig:leukoover} 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/overLeuko.png}
		\caption{only leukocytes edges}
		\label{fig:leukoover}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Segmentation with the skeleton function}
Starting from the image \ref{fig:leukoover} we have to connect every single white point to the nearest. To do this task we use the function $imdilate$ to dilate all the white dots with a diamond structural element with the size of 6 pixels. after this step we apply the closing of the opening with two disk respectively of the size 3 and 4 pixels. Now we can apply the skeleton function or the thinning of the edges. To do this passage we use the Matlab function $bwmorph$ that it's not the best function to do this but is the faster one. We try another skeleton external function written by N. Howe that is very interesting because has a precision to compute the skeleton of the image that is very impressive, but because the Pc latency we can't use the last one function. After the skeleton application we obtain an image that contains some spurious branches \ref{fig:skel}. 

\bigskip

To solve this problem is possible to use the Matlab function $bwmorph$ to prune the spurious branches, but in this case the function doesn’t work very well. For this reason we implement a code to resolve the problem. Our code is like a parser that for each point it's see if it is a part of a close circle or not. If it's not a part of a loop the code deletes this point. In a nutshell we save only the point that stay in a 'road' with the starting point and the end point coincident. Below you can read a snippet of pruning code.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/skel.png}
		\caption{skeleton of leukocytes with irregular branches}
		\label{fig:skel}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{scriptsize}
	\begin{lstlisting} [frame=single]
B = branchpoints;
E = endpoints;
[y,x] = Image;
Dmask = false(size(skel));
	for k = 1:numel(x)
    	D = bwdistgeodesic(skel,x(k),y(k));
    	distanceToBranchPt = min(D(B));
    	Dmask(D < distanceToBranchPt) =true;
	end
skelD = skel - Dmask;
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{minipage}
The result that we obtain from the skeleton application is a summary work, indeed we obtain an over-segmentation as is viewable from the image \ref{fig:skelfin}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/skelfin.png}
		\caption{skeleton of leukocytes with no spurious branches}
		\label{fig:skelfin}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
This over-segmentation isn't good for the correct visualization of leukocytes, but gives us a starting point to improve the solution and to obtain a better result.
Then we try to combine the various result to obtain a segmentation that was similar to the original image. First of all we close all the holes that are inside the image, to obtain a sort of black and white mask. Another fundamental step is sum the skeleton image with the mask. Doing this step we can separate the foreground by the background. Now we can use for the last time the map of edges that we used to calculate the VFC field. We use it summing it up with the image of leukocytes in foreground and passing the result of this operation as input to the function $bwareafilt$. We do this because this function extracts all connected components (objects)
from a binary image where the area is in range, producing the segmented image of the leukocytes \ref{fig:bwarea}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/segmentation.png}
		\caption{final leukocytes segmentation }
		\label{fig:bwarea}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\section{Cells counting}
To understand if all that we did had a sense, we have to do a counting of the cells. Because the images have a low definition we can found an over segmentation inside the cells, but it's easy to overtake this problem without consider the little regions that are inside the image. Then if we delete all the regions that are less than an upperbound we can have the exact number of leukocytes inside the image. We do this using the following snippet code
\bigskip
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting} [frame=single]
CC = bwconncomp(BW2,8);
numPixels = cellfun(@numel,CC.PixelIdxList);
[~,idx] = min(numPixels);

while min(numPixels) < cellsize/2
    BW2(CC.PixelIdxList{idx}) = 0;
    CC = bwconncomp(BW2,8);
    numPixels = cellfun(@numel,CC.PixelIdxList);
    [~,idx] = min(numPixels);
end
[labeledImage, numberOfObject] = bwlabel(BW2);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\bigskip

The resulting image of this consider only the the regions that are the same size of the nucleus or bigger.
